# Visual-Content Query System (VCQS)

## Project Description
VCQS is a system designed for the efficient retrieval of images from large databases, using color and intensity features of images. It employs a user-driven relevance feedback mechanism to enhance the accuracy of search results.

## Features
- Extraction of color and intensity features from images.
- Implementation of Manhattan distance for similarity measurement.
- Relevance feedback mechanism for refined search results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Akhil-Harsha/Visual-Content-Query-System.git'.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio and build the project.

## Usage
- Run the application.
- Select an image as the query for retrieval.
- Choose the method of search: intensity-based, color-code-based, or a combination.
- Provide feedback on the relevance of retrieved images to refine future searches.

## How It Works
- The system extracts color and intensity features from each image.
- When a query is made, it compares these features with those of the database images.
- Relevance feedback from users is used to adjust the search algorithm.
